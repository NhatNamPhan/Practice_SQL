EX 16: Window Aggregate Functions
1. Show each sale with a running total of sale_amount ordered by sale_date.

2. For each region, calculate a running total per region ordered by sale_date.

3. Show each sale with the average sale_amount per region (using AVG() OVER (PARTITION BY region)).

4. Find each customer’s total and average spending using window functions (no GROUP BY).

5. Show each region’s sale and its difference from the previous sale (use LAG()).
